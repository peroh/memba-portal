# Portsea Member Management App

As Education Director at my lifesaving club I need to keep track of the courses
people take, the awards they have, and manage their paperwork. I built this
Django application to help me do all of those things. The Django models help
keep track of member data and `pdfgen` automates some of the paperwork.
